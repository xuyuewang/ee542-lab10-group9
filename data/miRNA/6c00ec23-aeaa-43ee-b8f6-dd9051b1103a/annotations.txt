96d82ca1-5e27-5048-82d5-ee5886437580	22107	analyte	5a676d7d-0b8d-48fb-b898-0eb023a871e1	BCR Notification	Notification	2014-09-05T00:00:00	Approved	Possible tumor/normal sample swap, cross-contamination, and/or sample purity issues. The sequencing and characterization centers have reported that molecular signature of the tumor DNA and RNA cluster with the normal controls. Their analysis suggests that the purity of the tumor is very low. Therefore, the data from this patient should be used with caution.
